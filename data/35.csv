Participation in investigational device trials not encompassed by the IDE protocol should be performed remotely from the fenestrated procedure (&gt; 30 days). Examples include remote (&gt;30 days) participation in a thoracic, abdominal or iliac branch device trial, or participation in a percutaneous aortic valve trial. Participation in medical therapy trial or advanced imaging trial designed to improve peri-operative outcomes or to reduce radiation exposure of fenestrated-branched endografts may be concurrent with the IDE study.

35,42424,NCT02089607,"<p>Additional anatomical inclusion criteria for aortic arch devices:</p><ul>
<li>Proximal aortic fixation zone: a. Native aorta or surgical graft; b. Diameter: 20-42mm; c. Proximal neck length ≥ 20mm; d. Ascending aortic length ≥50mm; e. Must occur distal to coronary arteries and any coronary artery bypass grafts that are considered patent and necessary for proper cardiac perfusion</li>
<li>Distal aortic fixation zone:; a. Native aorta or surgical graft; b. Diameter: 20-42mm; c. Distal neck length ≥20mm</li>
<li>Supra-aortic trunk (brachiocephalic) vessels: a. Although the prosthesis will typically have two branches, modifications to the design will allow for a single branch, three branches or combination of branch and scallop if a customized version is required. Thus, it is generally planned that at least one extra-anatomic bypass graft will be done in conjunction (or in a staged fashion) with the procedure, unless three branches are planned. The two vessels incorporated into the endograft repair would most commonly be the innominate artery and left common carotid artery. However, the innominate artery may be coupled with the left subclavian artery in the setting of a bovine arch whereby the flow to the left carotid would come from a left subclavian to carotid bypass. Similarly, the left carotid and subclavian artery may be branched, or simply one vessel branched should specific anatomic limitations exist. In such a situation, multiple extra-anatomic bypasses may be necessary. A design with a single subclavian retrograde branch and double scallop to the left carotid artery may be used to extent the landing zone to Zone 1. Finally, a design with two antegrade inner branches for the innominate and left common carotid, and one retrograde inner branch for the left subclavian artery may be used in select cases. Thus the inclusion criteria are defined for each artery, yet any combination of arteries may be used for a repair: Innominate artery (Native vessel or surgical graft, Diameter: 8-22mm, Length of sealing zone ≥10mm, Acceptable tortuosity); Left (or right) common carotid artery (Native vessel or surgical graft, Diameter 6-16mm, Length of sealing zone ≥10mm, Acceptable tortuosity); Left (or right) common carotid artery (Native vessel or surgical graft, Diameter: 5-20mm, Length of sealing zone ≥10mm, Acceptable tortuosity).</li>

<li>Iliac anatomy must allow for the delivery of the arch branch device which is loaded within a 20F-24F sheath. Thus the iliac requirements are no different than the standard thoracic protocol. Conduits to the iliac vessels or aorta may be used if deemed necessary.</li>
